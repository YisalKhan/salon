== Upgrade Notice ==

= 3.0 =
Read Carefully before update: <br />
This is a major update of Salon Booking. <br /><br />

We highly suggest you to: <br /><br />

1 - back-up your files ( even Salon Booking 2.3.2 version )<br />
2 - back-up your database<br />
3 - back-up your translations<br />
4 - back-up your CSS customisations<br /><br />

The 2.4 version has changed the front-end booking form layout and some CSS classes has been changed too. Be prepared to update your CSS customisations once the update of Salon Booking has been completed.<br /><br />

The 2.4 version has a new algorithm, more precise, and require a “Database updater” to be launched once the new version has been installed.<br /><br />

In case of doubts you could install this new version on a development website first and check what’s new.<br />
If you feel confident with the new version you can proceed with the plugin update on your production website.<br /><br />
